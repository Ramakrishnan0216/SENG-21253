Nearly half a century ago, our legendary brand of hospitality was born on this very coastline. From the warm hearts of a Sri Lankan family, the values of passion, humility, integrity, and tenacity were brought to life in a charming beachside villa that has since inspired a world of luxury spread across our tropical isle. It all began here – at our original home of Sri Lankan hospitality. The home in which we welcomed the world as part of our family, and treated the world as one of our own. From mouth-watering meals to unique experiences, we have always been delighted to share the magic of our land with you. And today, as our timeless seas hold a wealth of stories past, we invite you to our nostalgic shores to begin one of your own.
